Review by Bernardo Reis - 57802

Review of Factory Pattern - Patterns element 3 made by Martim Gouveia 57482.

This pattern is well identified, the document has all the sections combined(Code snippet, justification, Code location) but it's still easy to understand.
The document could have a UML structure explaining the Factory pattern, but it is not necessary.
