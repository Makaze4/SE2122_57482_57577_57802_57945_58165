Review of Data Class - Code smells element 1 made by Pedro Louren√ßo 57577

This code smell is well identified, it has all the necessary sections for a good identification of the code smell(Code Snippet, Code location, Justification and refactoring proposal).
The refactoring proposal description is well explained, and it is appropriate for the problem.
